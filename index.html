        <h2>Problem Statement: Freshy Buddy</h2>
        </a>
      <p>Freshman, transfer, or international college students new to campus often find themselves alone at the gym,
         the library, and dining halls. Making friends with matching schedules at a big school is hard! Our users
         would like to find people whose schedules match their own, and who have similar interests. They would 
         appreciate having a buddy with similar plans -- whether itâ€™s a workout plan, study plan, or meal plan!</p>
