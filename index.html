          <p>Freshman, transfer, or international college students new to campus often find themselves alone at the gym,
            the library, and dining halls. Making friends with matching schedules at a big school is hard! Our users
            would like to find people whose schedules match their own, and who have similar interests. They would 
            appreciate having a buddy with similar plans -- whether it’s a workout plan, study plan, or meal plan!</p>

        <p>My group and worked together to brainstrom for our idea Freshy Buddy. We
